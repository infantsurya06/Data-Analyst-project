This project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on certain diagnostic measurements. The dataset used in this project is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK). The objective is to diagnostically predict whether a patient has diabetes using machine learning algorithms.

## Dataset Description 📊

The dataset consists of diagnostic measurements and outcomes for female patients of Pima Indian heritage who are at least 21 years old. The following are the columns included in the dataset:

- **Pregnancies:** Number of times pregnant
- **Glucose:** Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
- **Blood Pressure:** Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- **Skin Thickness:** Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
- **Insulin:** 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- **BMI:** Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
- **Diabetes:** Diabetes pedigree function
- **Age:** Age in years
- **Outcome:** Class variable (0 if non-diabetic, 1 if diabetic)

## Technologies Used 🛠️

- **Excel:** For initial data exploration and preprocessing.
- **SQL:** For database operations if applicable.
- **Python:** Programming language used for data manipulation, analysis, and model development.
- **NumPy:** Library for numerical computing.
- **Pandas:** Library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib:** Library for data visualization.
- **scikit-learn:** Library for machine learning algorithms.
- **Jupyter:** Interactive notebooks for data exploration and model development.
- **Django:** Web framework used for frontend and backend development.
